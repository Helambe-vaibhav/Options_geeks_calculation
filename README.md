# 📈 Mastering Option Greeks: A Quantitative Approach  

This repository provides an in-depth analysis of **Option Greeks**, their interactions, and **option pricing calculations** using the **Black-Scholes model**. We explore how Greeks behave under different market conditions, how they impact **option pricing and risk management**, and provide tools for **implied volatility calculations**.

## 🚀 Overview  

This repository covers:  
✅ **Option Greeks Calculation** (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho).  
✅ **Black-Scholes Pricing Model** for call and put options.  
✅ **Implied Volatility Calculation** using the Newton-Raphson method.  
✅ **Visualizing Greeks Behavior & Interactions** under different conditions.

## 📌 Option Greeks  

| Greek  | Definition | Key Insights |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Delta (Δ)**  | Sensitivity of option price to stock price changes. | High for ITM options, near 0 for OTM options. Call Delta is positive, Put Delta is negative. |
| **Gamma (Γ)**  | Rate of change of Delta. | Highest for ATM options and near expiry. Indicates risk from Delta fluctuations. |
| **Theta (Θ)**  | Measures time decay of option value. | Most negative for ATM options near expiry. Short-term options decay faster. |
| **Vega (ν)**  | Sensitivity to changes in implied volatility. | Highest for ATM options and longer expiries. IV changes affect Vega significantly. |
| **Rho (ρ)**  | Sensitivity to interest rate changes. | Call options increase with rate hikes, puts decrease. Impact is small for near-expiry options. |

## 📊 Analyses & Visualizations  

### 🔹 1. **Greek Behavior vs. Stock Price**  
📌 Examines how Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho fluctuate as the stock price moves.  

### 🔹 2. **Greek Interactions & Market Conditions**  
✔️ **Delta & Gamma Interaction:** High Gamma → Rapid Delta changes.  
✔️ **Delta & Vega Interaction:** High Vega → Larger Delta swings with volatility.  
✔️ **Gamma & Theta Interaction:** High Gamma → Faster Theta decay.  
✔️ **Vega & Theta Interaction:** Options with high Vega lose value slower due to Theta decay.  
✔️ **Rho & Vega Interaction:** Interest rate changes impact Vega for long-term options.  

### 🔹 3. **Black-Scholes Model & Option Pricing**  
📌 Calculate **call & put prices** using the **Black-Scholes formula**.  
📌 Estimate **implied volatility** using **Newton-Raphson**.  

### 🔹 4. **Effect of Time to Expiry (T) & Strike Price (K)**  
📌 **Theta Decay vs. Gamma Spikes:** ATM options experience the fastest Theta decay.  
📌 **IV Smile & Skew:** IV varies across strikes, impacting Vega & Gamma.  
📌 **Sensitivity of Greeks to Time Decay:** Theta, Gamma, Vega, and Delta change as expiry nears.  
📌 **Impact of Strike Price on Greeks:** ATM options have the highest Gamma and Vega.  

### 🔹 5. **Implied Volatility & Its Effect on Greeks**  
📌 **Impact of IV on Greeks:** Higher IV increases Vega, decreases Gamma, and increases Theta decay.  
📌 **Skewness & Smile in IV:** Higher IV for ITM and OTM options impacts Vega, Gamma, and Theta.  

### 🔹 6. **Risk-Free Rate & Greeks**  
📌 **Impact of R on Greeks:** Delta, Rho, and Theta shift when interest rates change.  

### 🔹 7. **Hedging & Portfolio Stability**  
📌 **Effect of Gamma on Hedging:** High Gamma requires frequent rebalancing.  
📌 **Theta Decay & Gamma Spikes:** Expiry leads to accelerated Theta decay and increased Gamma risk.  

## 📢 Conclusion  

Understanding **Option Greeks** and **option pricing** is crucial for traders and risk managers. This repository provides:  

✅ A **practical tool** to analyze Greeks & price options.  
✅ **Visualizations** for better insights.  
✅ **Code implementation** of the **Black-Scholes pricing model** & **Implied Volatility calculations**.
